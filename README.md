Here’s a README file for your project that you can use and modify as needed:

EntertainMe

EntertainMe is a Flask-based web application designed to let users explore and rate movies, add films to their watchlist, and track the films they have watched or plan to watch. The application is integrated with a movie database, allowing users to see movie details, posters, and even rate their favorite films.

This project is currently under active development, and new features and improvements are being added continuously.

Features

	•	User Authentication: Users can sign up, sign in, and manage their account securely.
	•	Quiz Mode: Users can take a quiz to rate random movies and add them to their watchlist.
	•	Watchlist: Users can add movies to their personal watchlist and view them later.
	•	Dynamic Movie Data: Movie titles, posters, and details are fetched from an external movie database (TMDb API integration).
	•	Session Management: Once logged in, users can manage their movies and continue where they left off.
	•	Movie Scoring: Users can rate movies on a scale of 1-10, and the app will suggest new movies to rate.
	•	Responsive UI: Designed with a dark theme for an engaging user experience.

Tech Stack

	•	Backend: Flask (Python)
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS (with Jinja templating)
	•	Database: MariaDB/MySQL
	•	Containerization: Docker with Docker Compose
	•	Testing: pytest with pytest-flask
	•	External APIs: TMDb API (for movie data)

Current Progress

The project is currently in development. Below is a list of features currently implemented:

	•	User signup, login, and authentication.
	•	Movie quiz feature, allowing users to rate movies and add them to their watchlist.
	•	Watchlist retrieval and display on the homepage.
	•	Unit and integration tests for various components, including user authentication, movie quiz functionality, and watchlist management.

Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.12+
	•	Docker (with Docker Compose)
	•	Access to a MariaDB or MySQL database

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/entertainme.git
cd entertainme


	2.	Set up your virtual environment and install the dependencies:

python -m venv my-venv
source my-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Create .env.development and .env.test files for your environment settings:
	•	Example .env.development:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=entertainme_db


	•	Example .env.test:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=entertainme_test_db


	4.	Set up the Docker containers (database and app):

docker-compose up --build


	5.	Run migrations and initialize the database schema:

flask db upgrade


	6.	Run the development server:

flask run



Running Tests

To run the test suite with pytest:

pytest

Tests include unit tests for user authentication, movie rating, and functional tests for the watchlist.
